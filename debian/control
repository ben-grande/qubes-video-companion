Description: Securely stream webcams and share screens across virtual machines
 Qubes Video Companion is a tool for securely streaming webcams and sharing
 screens across virtual machines.
 .
 It accomplishes this by creating a uni-directional flow of raw video that is
 passed from one virtual machine to another through file descriptors thereby
 allowing both machines to be completely air-gapped with no networking stacks
 exposed. This design makes the side of the video sending virtual machine 100%
 immune to attack and only leaves a very small attack surface on the side of the
 video receiving virtual machine.
 .
 The project emphasizes correctness and security all the while also sporting
 superb performance by maintaining a small footprint of the available
 computational resources and low latency even at Full HD and greater resolutions
 at 30 or more frames per second.
 .
 This package contains all components of Qubes Video Companion excluding the
 Qubes RPC policies which dom0 enforces.
